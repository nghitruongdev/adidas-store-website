# Adidas Store Website

This is the repository for my personal project to learn more about building websites and making them more functional using JavaScript. The website is an e-commerce platform for Adidas products and contains different pages, including the homepage, about page, and sign-in/sign-up pages.

## Technologies Used

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with additional libraries like Bootstrap for styling and Firebase for authentication purposes.

## Main Features

- User can sign up or sign in using Firebase authentication with validation (Email and password authentication).
- User can view products on the homepage.
- User can add products to the cart, which is stored using local storage.
- User can view and manage cart items directly on the homepage, such as changing the quantity or removing items from the cart.
- User is prompted to remove items from the cart if the quantity reaches 0.
- Custom carousel for displaying products.

## Getting Started

To run the website locally, you can clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. Make sure to have an internet connection to use Firebase authentication and to view product images.
